Requirements:
Chibi library available from above site.
TimedAction available from http://arduino.cc

Description:

This code adapts the wsbridge example code as part of the chibi library to add channel scanning.  By default it scans through channels 0x0b-0x1a incrementing once a second.
When data is found, channel rotation is suspended 30 seconds to allow further collection of data.

TODO: add better support for reporting current listening channel that does not interfere with wsbridge and Wireshark.
